#The house price is correlated with the number of square feet of living space.

#Create a simple regression model of sqft_living to price
#Split data into training and testing.
#We use seed=0 so that everyone running this notebook gets the same results. In practice, you may set a random seed (or let GraphLab Create pick a random seed for you).
